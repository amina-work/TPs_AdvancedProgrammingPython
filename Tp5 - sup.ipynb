    "1) The program should introduce itself as a digital assistant and display their name. Store the name in a variable.\n",

The design phases may provide infrastructure and organizational changes for the new system, a data schema (relational schema), metadata (to define tables), a function hierarchy diagram, psuedocode for each module, or a protoype of the new system. \"\n",
